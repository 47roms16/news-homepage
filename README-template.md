### What I learned

- **CSS Grid:** I gained a deeper understanding of CSS Grid, especially how it automatically creates templates for rows and columns even when they're not explicitly defined.
- **JavaScript Toggle Functionality:** I improved my understanding of the `toggle` method and its quirks, especially when it comes to manipulating class names and using conditional logic to manage state. I also learned how to manage toggling behaviors in a way that ensures smooth user interactions.
- **ARIA Attributes:** I learned more about ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, such as `aria-expanded` and `aria-hidden`, and how they help improve accessibility. By using these attributes properly, I ensured that the mobile navigation is accessible to users with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
